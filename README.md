# team-profilegenerator
This application has been created for use in an office setting, wherein the manager or even a human resources
coordinator can generate an easy to read team roster for quick reference.
Each set of employee input in response to user prompts creates a separate card containing the employee's relevant information, and is populated by the input.
Github username is a clickable link that does navigate to the github page belonging to that user.
After all user prompts are answered, the last question provided in the application allows the user to create an additional employee card. The user is able to create as many cards as necessary to complete the entire roster.

All tests have passed as is evident by running npm run test in command line, shown in the walkthrough demonstration.

Inquirer and jest packages were used in this project.
